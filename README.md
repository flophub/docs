##### What is FlopHub?
FlopHub is a platform for buying and selling computational power. It is a marketplace for people who need computational power and people who have computational power to sell.

##### How does FlopHub work?
Flophub uses multiple open source and internal tools to bring together hardware users and sellers leveraging a variant of Kubernetes as a backbone.

##### How do I buy computational power?
You can make a client account and book one or more machines instantly.

##### How do I sell computational power?
Simply run the script on your Ubuntu machine and your machine will become a node on our network within seconds! 

##### What if I have a Windows machine I want to rent out?
Coming soon: A method for adding a Windows-based node to our network.

##### What if I have a Mac with Apple M1/M2 that I want to rent out?
Apple Silicon has demonstrated its ability to perform heavy machine learning compute at an electrical cost of ~$.01/hour. We are actively working on a solution allowing a Mac based node at the same time apple is building ML libraries that work on Silicon. For the time being, most models are built for Nvidia.

##### How do I get paid?
You can see how much money you have earned in the dual dashboard. Payout will happen automatically as soon as possible as long as you have added your payment information.

##### How do I add credit to my account?
You do not need to add credit, however you will be asked for credit card information before you can open a session, similar to AWS.

##### How do I withdraw money from my account?
There is no account to withdrawl from -- payouts to hosts are paid automatically and an authorization is places on a clients credit cars at the time of booking. The client is billed for the usage upon closure of a session or at periodic intervals when pending use reaches a threshold.

##### How do I add a node to my account?
When you book an additional node, you will be billed per node at the time you add that node to your namespace. You will instantly have access to it in your local kubectl context accessible via terminal.

##### How do I remove a node from my account?
Simply remove it using our CLI or on the website by clicking 'remove node' in the dashboard.

##### What about Quantum Computers?
While GPU processing is favorable today, we are poised to be the first open marketplace for Qubits.
